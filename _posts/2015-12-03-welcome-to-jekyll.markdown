See how easy it is to deploy websites with Distelli? Create a repeatable deployment process that keeps you doing what you do best. Writing engaging content or writing cool applications.

{% highlight javascript %}
var express = require('express');
var app = express();

app.get('/', function(){
	res.send("Hello World");
});

app.listen('3000', function(){
	console.log('Magic is happening on Port 3000');
});
{% endhighlight %}

It is very easy to create content very quickly and stay ahead of others! Using Jekyll to create static websites enables Content writers to continue focus on writing content and not on how to get that content onto the internet. When you combine Jekyll with Distelli it is even easier to keep focused on important tasks!
